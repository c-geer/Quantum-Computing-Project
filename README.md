This is the code used in our Quantum Computing Project submission. 
All code related to our Grover's algorithm implementations are in the folder called Grover's algorithm. The code related to Deutsch-Jozsa is likewise in the Duetsch-Jozsa folder. The redundant code folder contains preliminary code and code that ended up not being necessary in the final implementation.
